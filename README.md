All .js files are in javascript folder.
All media files are in images folder.
We used Animate.css as library.

We did add-on tasks. Log In button, Sign Up button, header, soyummy, searching marker, userLocation marker, add button, the whole leftside

· Click search button to show search result on the left side and the marker on right side. Click result or more info link in markr will go the individualobjectpage.

· Click gps icon to locate current user position.

· Add buton located in left bottom of the page, click to submission page.

· Right click on the map in submission page will auto fill the coordinates and show marker.

· Since it is not convenient to display Google API on the mobile, and also using web map on mobile is annoying for users, so we only showing main functions(get current location, searching things) on the mobile without map. On the submission page, we need to input the position(longitude, latitude) by hands.
