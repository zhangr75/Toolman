All .js files are in javascript folder.
All media files are in images folder.
We used Animate.css as library.
All useful .php backend files are in php folder.

We did add-on tasks. Users who logged in could able to submit reviews and refresh the part of the page(not the whole page)

We used PHP Data Object(PDO) API for database access.

Each input/textarea place is validated in the backend and frontend

Also, S3 bucket is working properly, and we put images into the bucket and store the URL of the images in the database. Users could see the image if they upload the image and those images will show on the result of the searching things.


Instructions:

we prepopulated 5 restraurants in the databse for searching, whcih are "soyummy, Coco milktea, The Ship, The Alley, August 8". Users should input exact name or rate of restaurants for searching restaurants properly. If want to search based on rate, then do not enter anything into input box. One/Multiple restaurants will all showed on the left side of the page(include one image if they uploaded for that restaurant), and markers will showed up on the map.
